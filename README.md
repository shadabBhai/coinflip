# Solana Coinflip Game

This is a simple coin flip game implemented on the Solana blockchain. Users can connect their Solana wallet, choose a side (Heads or Tails), risk some tokens (SOL), and flip a virtual coin. If the coin lands on the selected side, users get double the amount they risked. Otherwise, they get nothing.
